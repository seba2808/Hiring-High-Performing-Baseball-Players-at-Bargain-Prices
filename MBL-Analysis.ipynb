    "# Explaining MBL player Salaries vs. Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Objective, Dataset and Analytical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 The Objective\n",
    "In this project we would like to do some analysis to find out if baseball players are fairly compensated and if their performance is reflected in their compensation. Are there players that get disproportionately compensated compared to their peers? Are some overpaid or underpaid? We want to see if there are big outliers when comparing performance and salary. Furthermore, we want to find out if salaries increase linear with performance or exponentially. Are superstars being worth their money? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 The Dataset\n",
    "To answer the above questions, we will work with a database with historical data from the MBL. The data originally came from [Sean Lahman's site](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/), and was transformed to a [sqlite database](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/224/lahman2015.sqlite).\n",
    "\n",
    "The database contains a number of tables with statistics on baseball players from 1871 to 2015.\n",
    "The main tables that contain the data that we need are:\n",
    " - Master -- contains information about players (including names)\n",
    " - Batting -- contains information on batting by year.\n",
    " - Pitching -- information on pitching by year.\n",
    " - Fielding -- information on fielding by year.\n",
    " - Salaries -- salary data for each player by year, starting in 1985.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 The Analytical Approach\n",
    "To analyze if the players are compensated fairly based on their performance need two pieces of data, the player salary and the player performance. For this analysis we will only use the data of one year to ensure comparability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The salary is available in a database for each player. However the performance is a bitg more tricky to judge. The good news is that the database contains all information that is relevant to a players performance and it should allow us to construct a performance score/index. Unfortunately I am not a Baseball expert - hence I don't know which metric one would look at to judge a good player from a bad one. But this is not problem as we can leverage data science to solve for this issue. We can find out which features of a player correlate the strongest with player salaries. We can take the to 5 and create a weighted average that represents the player performance score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the performance for each player, we can look at the corellation between performance and salary. The most telling analysis will be the scatter chart of salary over performance where we can observe how well the dots line up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we will perform the following analytical steps:\n",
    "1. Connect to the MBL player database and get take an initial look at the player salaries \n",
    "1. Correlate player features with salaries and identify the most significant features\n",
    "2. Define and compute a player performance score based on the most significant features\n",
    "3. Correlate salary and performance\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the data to be comparable, we will only use the data from most recent year which is 2015. You can easily conduct the analysis for other years as well and even see if the pay for performance has changed over the years.\n"

    "- Most features don't have a very strong positive or negative correlation\n",
    "- Highest(negative) correlation is with the player birth year - which shows that the years of age/experience have a major impact on player salaries. Younger players just earn less than their older colleagues.\n",
    "- Other than that, pitching performance (_p) seems to have a strong impact on salary - batting is only 2nd\n",
    "- For fielding the only feature that seem half way relevant is CS (`Opponents Caught Stealing (by catchers)`)\n",
    "- Correlation of salary with itself is 1 - which was to be expected\n",
    "- The correlation with year ID is 0 - also not a surprise because the year is the same (2015) for all players\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the correlation of salary to the player features, we can start to build a performance score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Player Performance Score\n",
    "To develop the performance score, we will take the 5 features that are most significant for player salary and create a weighted average. Let's look at the features that came out highest.\n",
    "1. m_birthYear: The birth year of the player floats up with a correlation of -0.409. Whilst this is easy to esplain with the player experience and the players climbing up the salary ladder over time, it is not a great indicator of performance. So we will not include this in the score and better look down the list\n",
    "2. `p_IPouts`: If we look this up [in the readme document](http://seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2016.txt), we can see that this refers to `Outs Pitched (innings pitched x 3)` in the pitching table (indicated by `p_` remembert we introduced prefixes `m_`, `b_`, `p_`, `f_` for the different tables so we can easier refer to the source). This seems to be a relevant performance score.\n",
    "3. `p_GS`: `Games Started` also a relevant feature. Not sure what exactly this means as I am not a baseball expert, but I guess if you are setup to start the game, you would be considered high performance by the coach\n",
    "4. `p_BFP`: `Batters faced by Pitcher` [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batters_faced_(baseball)) says that this is the number of batters who made a plate appearance before the pitcher in a game or in a season. This seems to be an interesting feature as I would imagine that good pitchers can beat more batters. \n",
    "5. `p_SO`: `Strikeouts` can be looked up on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout). In baseball, a strikeout (or strike-out) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat. It usually means the batter is out. This is very relevant for performance. As a coach we want to pay high salaries for players that do strikeouts.\n",
    "6. `p_W`: `Wins` - This does not require much explanation. This is what we pay players for - the ultimate performance score\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will use the features 2-6 above to create our score. If you want, you can add more features in the score to make it more accurate. Since their correlation is between 0.39 and 0.38 - there is no much difference in their significance. Hence, we will not weight the features but use a simple average to create the performance score. But before doing so, there are two more steps. First, we should to visualize the correlations in a scatter chart to see how much the features really correlate. After that we need to normalize the feature into a sub-score. This we can do by dividing the actual feature values by the maximum that a player has achieved in that category. Then we multiply by 100 to arrive at a score between 0 an 100. The values should all be positive - so we don't need to deal with negative values.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this chart the horizontal axis with the salary is on a logarithmic scale again. This time normalized however.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first look, we observe that there does not seem to be a strong correlation between the player salary and the performance. The dots on the chart look very scattered. However, if you look more carefully, you can discover that there are actually two correlations. On the left the players with lower salary get paid better if they perform better. On the right there is a group of players with high salaries. They also tend to get more salary if they perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have a two class society amongst players here. There are the working horses as I would call them, that work hard to get a slight increase and there are the celebrities that get payd better by an orde of magnitude regardless of performance and they can even increase their salary if they perform well. This is not really fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interesting finding and can be translated into insights for players and for club owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "For players it means that performance is rewarded however if you want to make a quantum leap in your pay, you need to become some kind of celebrity and become part of the club on the right side of the chart. We could do more analysis to find out what distinguishes these groups and on which features they perform differently so that it sets them apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "For club owners this result means that they should be able to hire great players at low prices. In fact, they would be better off using data science when hunting for their next player acquisition to get a better bang for the buck. Also, some players seem to be very overpaid and don't live up to the expectations that come with such a high salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer:\n",
    "As usual, please look at this analysis with a pinch of salt. While this gives us an indication, the analysis was not fully comprehensive. For example, we only looked at a sub-set of features. Performance might not be holistically defined by the 5 features we picked. You would expect high performing and highly paid players to perform well across all dimensions. Furthermore, some players might be valuable less because of their performance but because they are celebrities and bring in big advertising dollars. I would not recommend to make player purchase decision based on this analysis - but I would certainly recommend to use data science before your next player purchase."
