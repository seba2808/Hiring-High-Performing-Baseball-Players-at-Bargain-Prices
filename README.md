# Hiring High Performing Baseball Players at Bargain Prices - A Data Science Approach

The salary of major league baseball players can be astronomical, especially if they are star-players in their teams. This is a challenge for clubs that don't swim in cash. Therefore, we are trying to apply data science to this problem and identify high performing players that are still affordable for clubs with smaller wallets.

To achieve this objective, we need to find out if player salary is strictly fair and based on performance or if there are players that get disproportionately compensated compared to their peers. Are some overpaid or underpaid? We want to see if there are big outliers with high performance that have not yet astronomical pay. Does salary increase linear or exponentially with performance? And by making minor compromises on performance, can we get bargains on salary?

In this repository you find a datascience approach to answer these questions using a Jupyter notebook.
