    "# Hiring High Performing Baseball Players at Bargain Prices - A Data Science  Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Objective, Dataset and Analytical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The Objective\n",
    "The salary of major league baseball players can be astronomical, especially if they are star-players in their teams. This is a challenge for clubs that don't swim in cash. Therefore, we are trying to apply data science to this problem and identify high performing players that are still affordable for clubs with smaller wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this objective, we need to find out if player salary is strictly fair and based on performance or if there are players that get disproportionately compensated compared to their peers. Are some overpaid or underpaid? We want to see if there are big outliers with high performance that have not yet astronomical pay. Does salary increase linear or exponentially with performance? And by making minor compromises on performance, can we get bargains on salary?\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://images.pexels.com/photos/264279/pexels-photo-264279.jpeg?h=350&dpr=2&auto=compress&cs=tinysrgbl)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Dataset\n",
    "To answer the above questions, we will work with a database with historical data from the MBL (Major Baseball League). The data originally came from [Sean Lahman's site](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/), and was transformed to a [sqlite database](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/224/lahman2015.sqlite).\n",
    "\n",
    "The database contains a number of tables with statistics on baseball players from 1871 to 2015.\n",
    "The main tables that contain the data that we need are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Table |  Content |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Master | Contains information about players (including names) |\n",
    "| Batting | Contains information on batting by year |\n",
    "| Pitching | Information on pitching by year |\n",
    "| Fielding | Information on fielding by year |\n",
    "| Salaries | Salary data for each player by year, starting in 1985 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 The Approach\n",
    "To find outliers in performance vs. salary, we need two pieces of data: the player salary and the player performance. For this analysis we will only use the data of one year to ensure comparability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The salary is available in a database for each player. However, the performance is a bit more tricky to judge. The good news is that the database contains all information that is relevant to a player's performance and it should allow us to construct a performance score/index. Even without appealing to domain knowledge, we can leverage data science to come up with a performance index that should allow us to evaluate each player. We can find out which features are valued by coaches and club owners by looking at which features correlate the strongest with player salaries. We can take the top 5 and create a weighted average that represents the player performance score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the performance for each player, we can look at the correlation between performance and salary. The most telling analysis will be the scatter chart of salary over performance where we can easily observe the outliers that are still affordable compared to their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we will perform the following analytical steps:\n",
    "1. Connect to the MBL player database and take an initial look at the player salaries.\n",
    "1. Correlate player features with salaries and identify the most significant features.\n",
    "2. Define and compute a player performance score based on the most significant features.\n",
    "3. Correlate salary and performance and identify outliers.\n"

    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Player Performance Score\n",
    "To develop the performance score, we will take the 5 features that are most significant for player salary and create a weighted average. Let's look at the features that came out highest.\n",
    "1. `m_birthYear`: The birth year of the player floats up with a correlation of -0.409. Whilst this is easy to explain with the player experience and the players climbing up the salary ladder over time, it is not a great indicator of performance. So we will not include this in the score and better look down the list.\n",
    "2. `p_IPouts`: If we look this up [in the readme document](http://seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2016.txt), we can see that this refers to `Outs Pitched (innings pitched x 3)` in the pitching table (indicated by `p_` remember we introduced prefixes `m_`, `b_`, `p_`, `f_` for the different tables so we can easier refer to the source). This seems to be a relevant performance score.\n",
    "3. `p_GS`: `Games Started` also a relevant feature. Not sure what exactly this means as I am not a baseball expert, but I guess if you are setup to start the game, you would be considered high performance by the coach.\n",
    "4. `p_BFP`: `Batters faced by Pitcher` [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batters_faced_(baseball)) says that this is the number of batters who made a plate appearance before the pitcher in a game or in a season. This seems to be an interesting feature as I would imagine that good pitchers can beat more batters. \n",
    "5. `p_SO`: `Strikeouts` can be looked up on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout). In baseball, a strikeout (or strike-out) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat. It usually means the batter is out. This is very relevant for performance. As a coach we want to pay high salaries for players that do strikeouts.\n",
    "6. `p_W`: `Wins` - This does not require much explanation. This is what we pay players for - the ultimate performance score.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will use the features 2-6 above to create our score. If you want, you can add more features in the score to make it more accurate. Since their correlation is between 0.39 and 0.38 - there is no much difference in their significance. Hence, we will not weight the features but use a simple average to create the performance score. But before doing so, there are two more steps. First, we should to visualize the correlations in a scatter chart to see how much the features really correlate. After that we need to normalize the feature into a sub-score. This we can do by dividing the actual feature values by the maximum that a player has achieved in that category. Then we multiply by 100 to arrive at a score between 0 an 100. The values should all be positive - so we don't need to deal with negative values.\n",

    "The above charts show the five features over the salary in a scatter plot. Please note that the salary is on a logarithmic scale - as I was expecting the salary to go up exponentially with improvement in the respective features. Also, the amount on the axis is shown in millions as otherwise the tick labels get a bit difficult to read \n",
    "\n",
    "What we see is that the correlation is not great. There seems to be a minimum salary level that is payed once a player makes it to the MBL level - regardless of their performance. They would then have to work their way up. I would also imagine that the features explain the salary only in combination. Salaries only increase if you show performance on more than one feature. Hopefully this will be explained in our combined performance score.\n",

After that, we calculate the average of the normalized features as we don't apply a weight. Finally, we plot the performance score over the salary."

    "In this chart the horizontal axis with the salary is on a logarithmic scale again. This time normalized however. If you hover with the mouse over the dots, you can see player details.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first look, we observe that there does not seem to be a strong correlation between the player salary and the performance. The dots on the chart look very scattered. However, if you look more carefully, you can discover that there are actually two correlations. On the left the players with lower salary get paid better if they perform better. On the right there is a group of players with high salaries. They also tend to get more salary if they perform better.\n",

There are the working horses as I would call them, that work hard to get a slight increase and there are the celebrities that get paid better by an order of magnitude regardless of performance and they can even increase their salary if they perform well. This is not really fair, but an opportunity if we are in the market to hire/buy baseball players.\n",

    "## 4. Conclusion and Result\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that there is a two class society when it comes to baseball player salaries which is an interesting finding and can be translated into insights for club owners/coaches. If they are in the market to acquire good players this result means that they should be able to hire great players at low prices. They are much better off using data science when hunting for their next player acquisition to get a better bang for the buck. They only need to pick from the top left quadrant of the chart above, the \"value for money zone\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Another finding is that some players seem to be very overpaid and don't live up to the expectations that come with such a high salary. In this case the advice to club owners and coaches would be to carefully review these players and consider if they should remain in the team or be replaced by players with lesser salary yet similar performance.
